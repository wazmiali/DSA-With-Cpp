# DSA-With-Cpp

A repository of Data Structures & Algorithms implemented in C++.

## ✅ Purpose

This project serves as:

* A personal reference to reinforce and document fundamental DSA concepts in C++.
* A learning aid for students preparing for technical interviews, university exams (especially for B.Tech), and coding challenges.
* A growing collection which you can review, extend, and contribute to.

## 📂 What you’ll find

* Organized folders corresponding to lectures / chapters (e.g., Arrays, Searching, Sorting, OOPs).
* Each folder contains C++ source files (`.cpp`) implementing one or more algorithm/topic.
* Example topics: dynamic arrays, binary search, merge sort, pointers, encapsulation.
* Code written with readability in mind (clear variable names, comments, self-contained examples).

## 🛠 How to use

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wazmiali/DSA-With-Cpp.git  
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired topic folder.
3. Compile and run a C++ file using your preferred compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   g++ MyAlgorithm.cpp -o MyAlgorithm  
   ./MyAlgorithm  
   ```
4. Explore and modify the code — try adding your own test cases, optimize it, or extend with variants.

## ✍️ Contribution & Extension

* You’re welcome to add new topics (e.g., Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms).
* If you add code, please follow the existing naming/convention style, include comments, and optionally provide a test or readme snippet.
* For pull-requests: describe what you added/changed and why.
